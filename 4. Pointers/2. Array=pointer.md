<u>Whatever you can do with array, you can do it with pointers</u>

###### Byte Addressable System
=> every byte is going to get a different address

###### Word Addressable System
=> every word gets a different address

**Example**:
	if one word = 2 bytes
	then every word will get one address

consider a Byte addressable system:

- In all of the memory, there is no memory allocated to array name. Therefore, `a` is as good as writing the address (which is 100 in this case).
- Similarly, writing `*a` is as good as writing `a[0]` $$*a=a[0]$$
- Here to get to the next element using the pointer, we just need to add 1 to `*a` and we will reach the next element and we do not need to know the exact size of int in that system. This is called ==scaled arithmetic==.
- Arithmetically, this can be written as $$a+i=a+(i*\text{size of int)}$$
- and this is the reason we need to write int before pointing a pointer to an integer and char before pointing to a character.
- **Example**
```
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
    
    int *b = a;
    
    printf("%d\n", *b+1);
}
```

```
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int *p;
    int a[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
    
    p = &a[0];
    
    printf("%d\n", *p+1);
}
```

- In all these example `p` is a pointer whereas `a` is a nemonic.
- Due to this, one can perform arithmetic with `p` but no arithmetic can be performed with `a`.
- Whenever we want to pass an array, we pass the pointer to the array.
