- From the last printf statement we can say that we can treat array of pointers same as _multidimensional array_.
- In case of multidimensional array, each string has to be of same size and hence it is a waste of space as it is declared as `char array[3][13] = {"harsh", "dwivedi"}`.
- But, in array of pointers, each row can be of different sizes which is an advantage.
