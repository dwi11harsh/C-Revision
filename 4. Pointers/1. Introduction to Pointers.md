- In C, we can think of entire memory as a one dimensional array.
- It is faster(convenient) to use a variable with its address instead of its name.
- This is where pointers come into picture.
- **Pointers*** are used to handle addresses.
- Dynamically created data structures cannot have names and therefore need an address to access them.
- **Pointer*** is a variable which is supposed to hold the address of some other entity.
```
int b;
int *p;
p=&b;
```
- `&` is used for address and it is as good as reaching to the door.
- `*` is used for *dereferencing* or *indirection* and takes you inside the door of the house (which is the actual value stored in that address).
- So, in this previous example, according to the definition of the pointers `b` and `*p` are the same.
```
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int x = 100;
    int *y = &x;
    
    printf("x:  %d\n", x);
    printf("y:  %d\n", y);
    printf("*y: %d\n", *y);
    printf("&x: %d\n", &x);
}
```

```OUTPUT
/tmp/aDTlxQPxtM.o
x:  100
y:  -1252494716
*y: 100
&x: -1252494716
