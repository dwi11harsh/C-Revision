- Assignment of pointer of the same type
```
int *p, *q;
p = q; // legal
q = p; //legal
```
- Adding or subtracting a pointer and an int.
- Subtracting or comparing two pointer to member of the same array.
- Assigning or comparing to zero.
```
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char a[] = "dwivedi";
    char *p = "harsh";
    
    printf ("%s \t %s", a, p);
}
```

```Output
/tmp/yLSbtRZfsC.o
dwivedi 	 harsh

- The only difference is that array declared using a pointer is static string and we cannot edit it, whereas string declared using character array can be edited (for e.g. `a[2] = "r"`).
- A program to copy string from pointer t to s![[Screenshot 2024-10-20 at 9.24.59 PM.png]]

```
statement 1

*p = val;
p ++;

statement 2
*p++ = val;

both the statements are equivalent
```
