- Since we only use call by value in C, when we pass an array, the thing which is actually transferred is the address of the first element.
- Due to this we can use both of the following syntax to initialise such a function
```
fun(int a[5]);
```
OR
```
fun (int a[]);
```
- for 2 dimensional array
```
fun(int a[][6]);
```
we can leave the size of first dimension completely.
and this is also same as
```
fun (int (*a)[6]);
```

**NOTE**: No need to worry too much about this last stuff, it gets messy if you try to go deep.
**NOTE**: Go deep into this.
