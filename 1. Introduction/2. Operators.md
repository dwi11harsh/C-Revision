Depending upon the number of operands, an operator can be unary, binary or ternary
## Arithmetic

| Name           | symbol |
| -------------- | ------ |
| addition       | +      |
| substraction   | -      |
| multiplication | *      |
| division       | /      |
| modulus        | %      |
## Relational Operator
1. <
2. >
3. <=
4. >=
5. ==
6. !=
- The result of these operators is always 0 to 1
- Ex.1: printf (“%d”,20 > 10).       O/P: 1
- Ex.2: printf (“%d”,20 = = 10)    O/P: 0
## Assignment operator (=)
1. Typically, the system is $$Lvalue = Rvalue$$
2. Lvalue must be a variable.
3. Lvalue cannot be a literal or expression.
4. Rvalue can be an expression, variable, literal.
**Ex.** $$10=a;$$
$$a+b=c$$
- The result of the assignment is the value we are assigning, i.e. 
	```int x;``` 
	```x = 3 + (x = 10);```
	this is a perfectly valid statement
## Logical Operator
1. Logical AND ( && )
2. Logical OR ( || )
3. Logical NOT ( ! )
- Just like rational operators, the result of every logical operator is either 0 or 1.
- Logical NOT is a unary operator
- Logical NOT converts a non-zero operand into 0 and a zero operand in 1.
## Short Circuiting in Logical Operator
- in case of logical AND, if first operand is false, second is not evaluated
- in case of logical OR, if the first operand is true, second is not evaluated
## Increment and Decrement Operator
1. pre increment ++x 
2. post increment x++
3. pre decrement - -x
4. post decrement x - -
- **Pre-increment**: 
	- 1st step: Increment the value of variable
	- 2nd step: After increment, use the value of variable.
- **Post-increment**:
	- 1st step: Use the value.
	- 2nd step: Increase the value of variable
## Bitwise Operator
1. Bitwise AND (&)
2. Bitwise OR (|)
3. Bitwise XOR (^)
4. Bitwise Left Shift (<<)
5. Bitwise Right Shift (>>)
6. Bitwise Not (~)
- All these operators work on binary representation of numbers
- Typically, faster than arithmetic operators and other operators.
- ~x has output as – (x + 1)
- printf (“%d\n”, ~2) has output -3 i.e., -(2 + 1)
- **sizeof()** is used 
	- To find the number of elements present in an array
	- To dynamically allocate block of memory
## Ternary Operator ( ? : )
- It requires 3 operands i.e.,Left, Middle, Right
- Left ? Middle : Right
