- A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n", is called a ==character
string== or ==string constant==.

- 16-bits ints, which lie between -32768 and +32767, are common, as are 32-bit ints. 
- A float number is typically a 32-bit quantity, with at least six significant digits and magnitude generally between about $$10^{-38}-10^{38}$$

- During the conversion program of celsius to Fahrenheit, the reason for multiplying by 5 and dividing by 9 instead of just multiplying by 5/9 is that in C, as in many other languages, integer division truncates: any fractional part is discarded. Since 5 and 9 are integers. 5/9 would be truncated to zero and so all the Celsius temperatures would be reported as zero.

###### printf():
- first argument is a string of characters to be printed, with each % indicating where one of the other (second, third, ...) arguments is to be substituted, and in what form it is to be printed. For instance, %d specifies an integer argument, so the statement
- a tab (\t)
- if we augment each %d in the printf statement with a width, the numbers printed will be right-justified in their fields.
- For instance ``` printf("%3d %6d\n", fahr, celsius);```, to print the first number of each line in a field three digits wide, and the second in a field six digits wide.![[Screenshot 2024-10-20 at 9.36.49 AM.png]]

- Among others, printf also recognises %o for octal, %x for hexadecimal, %c for character, %s for character string and `%%` for itself.

###### float
- We were unable to use 5/9 in the previous version because integer division would truncate it to zero.
- A decimal point in a constant indicates that it is floating point, however, so 5.0/9.0 is not truncated because it is the ratio of two floating-point values.
