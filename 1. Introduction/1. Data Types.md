## Primitive Data Type
##### (a) Integer Types
1. short int
2. int
3. long int
4. long long int
##### (b) Character Types
1.  char
2. unsigned char
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    signed char x = -10;
    unsigned char y = 240;

    printf("x = %d\n", x);
    printf("y = %u\n", y);

    return 0;
}
```
- In C, `signed char` and `unsigned char` are both data types used to store characters and small integers. The main difference lies in the range of values they can represent
##### (c) Floating types
1. float
2. double
3. long double
##### (d) Other
1. void
2. bool
## Non - Primitive Data Type
##### (a) Derived data type:
1. Array
2. Pointer
3. String
##### (b) User defined data type
1. Structure
2. union
3. enum
4. typedef

- C standard does not specify how many bits or bytes to be allocated for every type and different compiler may choose different ranges.
- Only restriction is that short and int types are at least 16 bits, long types are at least 32 bits and short is no longer than int which is no longer that long type.
