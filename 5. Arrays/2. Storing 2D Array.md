## Row Major Order
=> Store each row one after another

#### For 0 indexing

Now, in order to reach `ith` element, the arithmetic that we need to perform is:
$$A[i][j]_{m*n}=((i*(\text{n}) + j)*\text{(size of each element)} + Base$$
so to reach element `A[2][1]`, the solution would look like:
$$A[2][1]=((2*4)+1)*2+100$$

#### For 1 indexing
$$A[i][j]_{m*n}=((i-1)*(\text{n}) + (j-1))*\text{(size of each element)} + Base$$

## Column Major Order
=> Store each column one after another

#### For 0 indexing

$$A[i][j]_{m*n}=(i + (j*m))*\text{(size of each element)} + Base$$

#### For 1 indexing
$$A[i][j]_{m*n}=((i-1) + ((j-1)*m))*\text{(size of each element)} + Base$$

# Row v/s Column Major Order
- In Case of ==Row Major Order==, if one accesses any row then he gets easy access to all the elements of that row in a single page
- In Case of ==Column Major Order==, if one accesses any column then he gets easy access to all the elements of that column in a single page
- Accessing the elements in this manner will decrease the number of page faults, as we will only get the page fault while accessing the first element.

**NOTE:** <u>Whenever we are sending a character array, we don't need to send the size of the array as each of string ends with a null character, But this is not the case with int or some other arrays and hence we need to send the size of those arrays.</u>
