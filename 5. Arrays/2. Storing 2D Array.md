Now, in order to reach `ith` element, the arithmetic that we need to perform is:
$$A[i][j]_{m*n}=((i*(\text{n}) + j)*\text{(size of each element)} + Base$$
so to reach element `A[2][1]`, the solution would look like:
$$A[2][1]=((2*4)+1)*2+100$$

#### For 1 indexing
$$A[i][j]_{m*n}=((i-1)*(\text{n}) + (j-1))*\text{(size of each element)} + Base$$
