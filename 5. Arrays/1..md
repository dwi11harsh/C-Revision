- Arrays allows random access.
- In order to access an element `i` in an array with 0 indexing, one needs to cross `i` elements.
- In case where the array index does not start with 0 and it starts with some `base` then in order to reach the `ith` element we need to $$base+i$$
- In case of 1 indexing, to reach `ith` element we need to cross `i-1` elements.
